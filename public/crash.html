      <h2>North Atlantic</h2>
      <h3>performed by MAZE Ensemble</h3>
      <div style="position: relative; text-align: left; z-index: -99;">
      <p>North Atlantic is a multimedia work written for MAZE ensemble. All the material of the piece is based off the wind forecast over the North Atlantic 
        on the week of performance. In particular, the material includes the video graphic score the performers use, the fixed media electronics and abstracted 
        visuals projected behind.</p>

        <p>The performers are given fixed pitches which they can use freely. The pitches come from the 5edo scale. Instead of dividing the octave into 12 notes, 
            it is divided into 5, which results in a microtonal scale.</p>
        
        <p>Each performer is placed within an area of the North Atlantic. The colour and strength of the wind, in their area, is mapped to a palette of techniques 
            and textures. They are also instructed to interact in certain ways when performers share the same bout of wind.</p>

    <h3>initial idea for multimedia work</h3>
    <div style="position: relative; text-align: left; z-index: -99;">
        <p>"</p><p>It is more than possible that the experience of the uncanny is radically underestimated for non-native speakers of Irish.</p>
        <p>For many, who have been born and grown up in Anglophone Ireland, the language can have a certain familiarity about it but, at the same time, remain disconcertingly strange.</p>
        <p>This sensation of being unsettled, of being in an uncertain, ambiguous space (the endless soul-searching about Irish identity) can, of course lead to resentful guilt or outright rejection.</p>
        <p>An ecological ethics based on appreciating, tolerating and accepting strangeness is, in many respects, a more realistic and more useful approach to 
        Irish-language learning for the majority population in Ireland than the older nationalist trope of sudden, effortless conversion</p>
        <p>What is more, the necessary humility faced with the unfamiliar becomes an ecological virtue as we lunlearn many of the prejudices we 
        had about the environment and come to a new understanding of it through the uncanny, long-term perspective of the language.</p>
        <p>Irish forces us to look at our surroundings anew and it is precisely the need to be jolted out of our complacency which becomes a pressing necessity in the midst of a climate crises.</p>
